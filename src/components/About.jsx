                I'm a full-stack developer with a deep commitment to creating products that
                enhance the lives of those in my community. As a 3rd year Mathematics student
                at the University of British Columbia, I strive to merge my academic pursuits
                with my passion for technology.
                <br />
                <br />
                My dedication to this field is not only shown in my academic endeavors, but 
                also in my personal projects and work for different organizations, where I 
                focus on utilizing my skills to drive positive change.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I'm not engaged in my academic or professional work, you can often find 
                me shredding the slopes ‚õ∑Ô∏è or the links üèåÔ∏è, winning hands in Poker ‚ô†Ô∏è, or relaxing to
                some music üéµ!
